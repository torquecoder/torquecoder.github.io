  Hi, my name's Shubham and I'm currently a SWE at Google Bangalore. I like to build large scale distributed systems.
  Apart from making awesome software systems, I love solo travelling around the globe.

  I am most skilled in <mark>devouring pizza</mark> and <mark>gulping coke</mark>

   - Blockchain technology (If you trust math then trust bitcoin)
   - FPS gaming
   - Working out (six pack abs coming soon!!)
